# microbit-pomodoro2
Second try at a microbit pomodoro timer. This time with micropython which is easer than make:code

My first attempt started with my son and the visual programming tools at make:code (though I switched to python mode at one point) https://github.com/evolarjun/pomodor-timer.

In this version the system is event driven and much more responsive to the button presses. I probably could have done this with the Make:Code version, but I kept running into issues. The micropython version was easier for me to grok and get through. Possibly if I had started with the python at Make:Code I wouldn't have struggled as much there.

Used https://python.microbit.org/v/3/reference to edit and flash the microbit.

Note that Chrome has the USB connection feature and can send on one click without requiring the copy to a USB drive.
